<a name="the-accounting-equation"> <h2> The Accounting Equation </h2></a>

1. __Assets__: Economic resources owned or controlled by the company that will provide future benefit to the company. 
   1. Examples:
      1. Cash
      2. Inventory
      3. Buildings
      4. Equipment etc.
2. 2 General Methods to Finance Assets
   1. __Liabilities__: Obligations satisfied through payment or services to someone else. We owe money or services in the future.
   2. __Owner's Equity__: Investments in the company by the owners; in obligation to pay that investments. Or profits left in the company. 
3. Balance Sheet Basics:
   1. Assets = Liabilities + Owner's Equity
   2. Assets (LHS): Economic resources owned or controlled by the business.
   3. Liabilities + Owner's Equity (RHS): Claims against those economic resources or in other words, the __source__ or __origin__ of the assets. 
   4. Accounting equation has to balance to answer the question: "Where did the assets come from?".
4. Statement of Cash Flows Basics:
   1. ``Assets`` from the Balance Sheet Equation contains information about the Assets in the form of Cash. The Statement of Cash Flows is a detailed analysis of cash going into and out of the cash account over a specified period of time. 
   2. Those inflows or outflows are characterized as one of the following:
      1. Operating Activities
      2. Investing Activities
      3. Financing Activities
   3. Sorting of the inflows and outflows by the aforementioned categories will give us the Statement of Cash Flows. 
5. Income Statement Basics:
   1. ``Owner's Equity`` from the Balance Sheet Equation comprises of:
      1. Paid In Capital: Amount of money directly invested by the owners of the business in the business. The amount of capital they have paid in.
      2. Retained Earnings: Earnings that have been retained in the business since inception.
         1. Dividends are earnings not retained in the business.
         2. These are subtracted out from the Total Earnings to give us the Retained Earnings.
      3.  Retained Earnings: Revenues - Expenses = Net Income.
          1.  Revenues provide resource inflows. Increases in resources from the sale of goods / services.
              1.  Not the same as cash but the __source__.
          2.  Expenses are resource outflows. They represent cost incurred.
              1.  How assets have been used.
